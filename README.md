# converse_hackathon

We used Myo armbands (https://www.myo.com) to compose music that is made of samples from the Converse Rubber Tracks Library. These samples are grabbed through a script (rt_music.py) that asks the user for genre and instruments. We then stream gesture data from the armbands to Max MSP using another script (myo_music.py). The gestures detemine what loops are used and when one-shots are played.
